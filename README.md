Steps:

(1). Download data from 2008-2012_ACSSF_All_In_2_Giant_Files(Experienced-Users-Only). Unpack All_Geographies_Not_Tracts_Block_Groups.tar.gz and 2012_ACS_Geography_Files.zip. All_Geographies_Not_Tracts_Block_Groups.tar.gz was called estimation file, and 2012_ACS_Geography_Files.zip was called geographic information.

(2). Yan developed python scripts to process the national datasets:
a. Read estimation file by running read_estfile.py, results were saved as est_output_US.txt.
b. Read geographic file by running read_geofile.py, results were saved as geo_output_US.txt.
c. Combine est_output_US.txt and geo_output_US.txt by running join_tables.py with Mapreduce.py in the same folder. This step generates a file final_US.txt.
d. Split the big table into small ones with 60000 rows for each one. Run split_final.py. This step generates output1.txt, output2.txt, output3.txt, output4.txt. 
e. Import the four files, output1.txt, output2.txt, output3.txt, output4.txt, into Excel 2003 file. ArcGIS 10.2 doesnâ€™t read Excel 2013.
f. Merge output1, output2, output3, output4 tables into one table, which is the national data dbf table. Do join with national CBG layer to produce a national data layer.
